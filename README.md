# How to Train Your Own LLM

- This guide walks you through **fine-tuning your own Large Language Model (LLM)** using **QLoRA**.  
- You‚Äôll start with an open-source base model, fine-tune it on your dataset, and export a quantized version that runs locally.
---

## üöÄ What You‚Äôll Build
- Fine-tune a base model on your own instructions.
- Merge + quantize it into a `.gguf` file.
- Run it in **LM Studio** (GUI) and **Ollama** (CLI).

---

## üì¶ Requirements
- **Windows 10/11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04)**
- **NVIDIA GPU (16GB+ VRAM recommended)**
- **Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)**
- **LM Studio** (for local inference)
- **Ollama** (for CLI inference)
