## üöÄ What This Hardware Can Handle

### Inference
- ‚úÖ **7B and 8B models (Llama 3, Mistral, Phi-3, Gemma)**  
  Runs comfortably in **Q4_K_M** quantization with 4096 context.  
- ‚ö° LM Studio / Ollama performance: ~100‚Äì160 tokens/sec (7B), ~90‚Äì130 tokens/sec (8B).  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 13B models are possible but limited by 16GB VRAM ‚Üí requires 4-bit quantization & smaller context length.  

### Fine-tuning (QLoRA)
- ‚úÖ **7B and 8B LoRA fine-tunes** are well supported.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **32GB system RAM** is a bottleneck for very large datasets ‚Üí consider upgrading to 64GB for smoother runs.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For 8B + long contexts (4k), gradient accumulation is required to fit training into VRAM.  
- ‚ùå **70B models** not feasible on this setup without cloud or multi-GPU.

## üõ†Ô∏è Strengths
- **High-end CPU (i9-13900K):** excellent preprocessing & tokenization speed.  
- **Powerful GPU (RTX 4080 SUPER 16GB):** ideal for local fine-tunes (7B‚Äì8B).  
- **Motherboard (Z690-E):** stable platform with PCIe Gen5 and strong VRM cooling.  
- **Storage (~30TB):** ample space for datasets, checkpoints, and multiple models.  
- **Cooling (360mm AIO):** keeps CPU stable during long fine-tuning runs.  
- **PSU (1000W):** headroom for overclocking, GPU spikes, or future multi-GPU setups.

## üîß Possible Upgrades
- **Memory:** Increase from 32GB ‚Üí 64GB DDR5 for handling larger datasets without swap.  
- **GPU:** Move to RTX 4090 (24GB) for smoother 13B training/inference.  
- **Storage layout:** Use 2‚Äì4TB NVMe Gen4 SSD dedicated to models/checkpoints; keep HDD for long-term archive.

## üìä Summary
This machine is **excellent for experimenting with 7B‚Äì8B models**, both inference and QLoRA fine-tuning.  
It has strong compute (i9-13900K + 4080 SUPER) and huge storage, but upgrading system memory would make it even more capable for large-dataset training.
